* basics
we will consider any tree to being binary for now..

after we study binary trees a bit we can go forward to non-binary ones.

the most basic binary tree has the following type:
#+begin_src kind
type Tree<A: Type>{
  nil
  node(
    left: Tree<A>
    val: A
    right: Tree<A>
  )
}
#+end_src

this means that an element of type =Tree= can be constructed in either of the two of the following ways:
- the simple element =Tree.nil=
- an object =Tree.node= that holds 2 Trees and a value

since a tree can actually hold anything (just like a list), we can make it dependent on a type, so that all values on the node are of that type.

also notice that the type =Tree.nil= represents the empty tree (just like =List.nil= represents the empty list) and it doesnt need to depend on anything.

the most basic tree is of the form =<nil, T, nil>=, so we can implement a function that returns it (so that we do not need to repeat it later)
#+begin_src kind
Tree.leaf<A: Type>(x: A): Tree<A>
  Tree.node!(
    Tree.nil!
    x
    Tree.nil!
  )
#+end_src

notice that =Tree.nil= is actually a function of the type =A -> Tree<A>=, so we need to give it the argument (even though it doesnt use it). because of that, we can use the ! to tell kind to infer the type and check it (a *very* cool feature).

with this we can implement a simple tree:

#+begin_src kind
my_tree: Tree<Nat>
  Tree.node!(
    Tree.leaf!(1)
    2
    Tree.leaf!(3)
  )
#+end_src

we can then implement =Tree.map=, which takes a tree and a function, and returns a new tree with that function applied to each element:

#+begin_src kind
Tree.map<T: Type, K: Type>(tree: Tree<T>, f: T -> K): Tree<K>
  case tree{
    nil:
      Tree.nil!
    node:
      Tree.node<K>(
	  Tree.map!!(tree.left, f)
	  f(tree.val)
	  Tree.map!!(tree.right, f)
      ) :: Tree<K>
  }
#+end_src
that is, just return nil on nil and map the function to the left and to the right. pretty simple right?

we can test it by evaluating for example:
#+begin_src kind
Tree: Tree<Nat>
  Tree.map!!(
	my_tree
	(x) x + x // the same as lambda (x): x + x
  ) 
#+end_src
i specially named the term =tree= so that we can run it (the same as the file name). kind is a bit fidgety with file names so i avoid getting in its way

we can then run this test doing the following:
#+begin_src bash
kind Tree --run
#+end_src

and we see that indeed it returned the tree times two:
#+begin_src bash
{ _: 'Tree.node',
  left:
   { _: 'Tree.node',
     left: { _: 'Tree.nil' },
     val: 2n,
     right: { _: 'Tree.nil' } },
  val: 4n,
  right:
   { _: 'Tree.node',
     left: { _: 'Tree.nil' },
     val: 6n,
     right: { _: 'Tree.nil' } } }
#+end_src

we can also implement the traversal functions =in_order=, =pre_order= and =post_order=, which simply transform a Tree into a list:
#+begin_src kind
Tree.in_order<A: Type>(tree: Tree<A>): List<A>
  case tree{
    nil:
      List.nil!
    node:
      List.concat!(
	  Tree.in_order!(tree.left),
        tree.val & Tree.in_order!(tree.right)
	) 
  }
  
Tree.pre_order<A: Type>(tree: Tree<A>): List<A>
  case tree{
    nil:
      List.nil!
    node:
      tree.val & List.concat!(
        Tree.pre_order!(tree.left)
        Tree.pre_order!(tree.right)
	)
  }
Tree.post_order<A: Type>(tree: Tree<A>): List<A>
  case tree{
    nil:
      List.nil!
    node:
      List.concat!(
        Tree.post_order!(tree.left)
        List.concat!(
	    Tree.post_order!(tree.right)
	    [tree.val]
	  )
      )
  }
#+end_src
notice that the infix =&= operator is just syntatic sugar for =List.cons=. since =List.cons= accepts a val and a list, we can only use if we are inserting =tree.val= to the left of another list. otherwise, we need to use =List.concat= to concatenate two lists.

we can also implement the size function:
#+begin_src kind
Tree.size<A: Type>(tree: Tree<A>): Nat
  case tree {
    nil:
	1
    node:
      1 + Tree.size!(tree.left) + Tree.size!(tree.right)
  }
#+end_src
and the two height functions:
#+begin_src kind
Tree.height<A: Type>(tree: Tree<A>): Nat
  // "normal height"
  case tree {
    nil:
      0
    node:
      1 + Nat.max(Tree.height!(tree.left), Tree.height!(tree.right))
  }
Tree.min_height<A: Type>(tree: Tree<A>): Nat
  // "normal height"
  case tree {
    nil:
      0
    node:
      1 + Nat.min(Tree.height!(tree.left), Tree.height!(tree.right))
  }
#+end_src



* completeness
we can check to see if a tree is complete (that is, all leaves have the same distance from the root) with the following function:
#+begin_src kind
Tree.complete<A: Type>(tree: Tree<A>): Bool
  case tree {
    nil: true
    node:
      Tree.complete!(tree.left) &&
      Tree.complete!(tree.right) &&
      Nat.eql(Tree.height!(tree.left), Tree.height!(tree.right))
  }
#+end_src

#+begin_src kind
full_tree_max_height<A:Type>(
	tree: Tree<A>
	H: Tree.complete<A>(tree) == true
): Nat.eql(Tree.height!(tree), Tree.min_height!(tree))
  ?cu
				   
#+end_src
