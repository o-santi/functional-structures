# functional structures

just a simples repo to record some annotations and implementations (and some proofs) of common data structures (trees, lists, vectors, maps...) presented in the book [Functional Algorithms Verified](https://functional-algorithms-verified.org/).

most of them are in [kind](https://github.com/kind-lang/Kind), so i recomend checking it out.
